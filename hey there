Hey Betsegaw!

How's it going? I just wanted to drop you a quick message to say hi and see how you're doing. I've been listening to your appearances on MERI PODCAST and I've gotta say, you're such an inspiration to me. Your insights and perspectives are really insightful and thought-provoking.

I was wondering if you'd be up for a chat sometime? I'd love to pick your brain on some of the topics you've been discussing on the podcast. Let me know if that sounds good to you!

Take care and talk soon.
